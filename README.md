# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

In the above project to implement the stick prediction using the LSTM model 
we had taken the Google Dataset and set the opening price of the stock as the parameter of study and had applied the LSTM model for the prediction of the next day opening price.

There we had used a 60 day openng prices of the stock to predic the 61th day opening price of the data and had trained the model same.
